A tutorial on how to make a photo album using CSS Grid.

Hey everyone!

Today we're going to be playing with photos. A LOT. You'll spend some time picking photos, but you'll spend most of your time arranging them. Welcome to... Grinterest!

### Steps

* Pick a theme and pick 25 photos from the internet for it. Unsplash.com can help with this! Feel free to spend a little time and have a little fun with the selection process. Obviously not too much time, though! Try to spend less than half an hour on this.
* Using CSS Grid, and only CSS Grid--implement a blank Holy Grail. This was a whole thing before, but it's going to be a little easier with Grid!
* What's going to go IN our Holy Grail? Put some text (and/or more images?) that fits your theme in your heading, footing, and sidebar. As to your navbar, put a link to nothing in there, but we'll be filling it in later.
